       As a continuing process of quality assurance the UGC recommended the institutionalization of internal system of quality assurance at University of Rajshahi through Institutional Quality Assurance Cell (IQAC) at University level. University of Rajshahi being fully aware of a high-quality learning experience for students immediately addressed the UGCs directive and established the IQAC.

The IQAC is expected to work closely with academic and administrative units across the University in maintaining internal as well as external quality assurance. In carrying out these responsibilities IQAC will facilitate the academic and administrative units of University of Rajshahi in program planning, development and review, and disseminate information and guidance on quality assurance through various means such as offering training and advice to faculty members and administrative staffs on the different processes. The IQAC is also responsible for ascertaining that the Universityâ€™s quality assurance policies and procedures are robust and effective in maintaining and monitoring the standards of its academic degrees and in supporting the enhancement of the studentsâ€™ learning experience.

Quality assurance is a team work and IQAC alone cannot implement it. The desired result of quality assurance at University of Rajshahi can only be achieved through the effective participation of all the stake holders.

I seek whole hearted and enthusiastic support from all.
